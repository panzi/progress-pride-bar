Pride Progress Bar
==================

A progress bar for the terminal that looks like the progress pride flag.

**Work in progress!**

It's not the intersex-inclusive version because I don't know of a way to render
the circle like that across two characters in the terminal. There seems to be no
fitting pair of Unicode symbols.
